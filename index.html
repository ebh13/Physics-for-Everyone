  <h1>Making Physics Accessible to All</h1>
  <p>Knowledge should never be a privilege.  
  Through free, interactive resources, we aim to make physics accessible to students, independent learners, and curious minds around the world — regardless of their financial background.</p>
</section>

<section class="content" id="why">
  <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
  <p>In 2023, the UNESCO Institute for Statistics reported that over 258 million children, adolescents, and youth were out of school globally, many of them lacking access to quality science education. Even among enrolled students, physics is often seen as one of the least accessible subjects due to the cost of materials, limited school resources, and a lack of hands-on, intuitive learning tools.</p>

  <p>Physics is not just an academic subject — it is a fundamental way of understanding the universe we live in. From energy to medicine, from space exploration to environmental technologies, physics drives innovation. Yet, many brilliant minds never get the chance to discover their potential because access to this knowledge is unevenly distributed.</p>

  <p>By providing free, interactive educational tools, we hope to empower students, hobbyists, and self-learners who might otherwise be left out. Our goal is to break the barriers between passion and opportunity, and create a space where learning is truly open to everyone.</p>
</section>

<section class="content" id="get-involved">
  <h2>How You Can Help</h2>
  <p>If you believe in democratizing education, there are several ways you can help. Share this website with students, teachers, and anyone interested in science. Provide feedback on how to improve these resources. If you have programming, writing, or science communication skills, you can also contribute by helping us expand the library with more interactive articles.</p>

  <p>Every visit, every shared link, every suggestion helps us get closer to a world where education is a right, not a privilege.</p>

  <p>Together, we can open more doors for curious minds everywhere.</p>
